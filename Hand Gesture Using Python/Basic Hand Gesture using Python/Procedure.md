# Hand Gesture Tracking using MediaPipe and DroidCam  
**Filename:** `HandGesturebasic.py`

---

## Project Overview

This project tracks your **hand gestures** in real-time using **MediaPipe** and displays the **skeleton (landmarks)** of your hand on the screen.  
You can use either your computerâ€™s webcam or your smartphone camera (through DroidCam).

---

## Step-by-Step Setup and Running Guide

### 1. Install Python

Make sure Python 3.7 or above is installed.  
Download it from the [official Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

To check if Python is installed, run:

```bash
python --version
```
or
```bash
python3 --version
```

---

### 2. Install Required Libraries

Open a terminal or command prompt and install these libraries:

```bash
pip install opencv-python mediapipe numpy
```

---

### 3. (Optional) Set Up DroidCam

If you want to use your smartphone as the camera:

1. Install **DroidCam** app on your smartphone (Android or iPhone).
2. Install the **DroidCam Client** on your computer:
   - [Download DroidCam Client](https://www.dev47apps.com/)
3. Open the DroidCam app on your phone and the client on your PC.
4. Connect via Wi-Fi or USB.
5. After connecting, a new camera device will appear on your PC (e.g., device `1`).

---

### 4. Download the Project Code

Clone this repository or download the `HandGesturebasic.py` file manually.

If you have Git installed:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/yourrepositoryname.git
```

Otherwise, click **Download ZIP** from GitHub and extract it.

---

### 5. Run the Script

Open a terminal in the project folder and run:

```bash
python HandGesturebasic.py
```

By default, it uses your laptop's webcam (device 0).

---

### 6. (Optional) Use DroidCam or Other Camera

If using DroidCam, you might need to select device 1 or another number:

Example:

```bash
python HandGesturebasic.py --device 1
```

You can also customize the camera resolution:

```bash
python HandGesturebasic.py --device 1 --width 1280 --height 720
```

---

### 7. Controls

- **View your hand skeleton**: Move your hand in front of the camera.
- **Exit the program**: Press the **ESC** key.

---

## Additional Options (Command Line Arguments)

| Argument | What It Does | Default Value |
|:---|:---|:---|
| `--device` | Choose which camera to use (0 = default webcam, 1 = DroidCam, etc.) | 0 |
| `--width` | Set the video frame width | 960 |
| `--height` | Set the video frame height | 540 |
| `--use_static_image_mode` | Use static image mode (better detection for still images) | False |
| `--min_detection_confidence` | Minimum confidence for detecting the hand | 0.7 |
| `--min_tracking_confidence` | Minimum confidence for tracking hand landmarks | 0.5 |

Example:

```bash
python HandGesturebasic.py --device 1 --width 1280 --height 720 --use_static_image_mode --min_detection_confidence 0.8 --min_tracking_confidence 0.7
```

---

## Important Notes

- Ensure good lighting for better hand detection.
- If video lags, reduce the resolution (example: 640x480).
- Make sure the correct camera device number is selected.
- DroidCam must be running properly on both phone and PC if using it.

## Credits

- [MediaPipe](https://mediapipe.dev/) by Google â€“ for hand landmark detection.
- [DroidCam](https://www.dev47apps.com/) â€“ for using smartphones as webcams.
- [OpenCV](https://opencv.org/) â€“ for video capture and display.

## Example Output

*(Insert a screenshot or GIF here showing your hand skeleton detection.)*

Example to insert an image:

```markdown

```

---

## Troubleshooting

| Problem | Solution |
|:---|:---|
| "Could not open camera." | Check if the correct device number is selected or if the camera is not used by another application. |
| "No hand detected." | Ensure your hand is fully visible to the camera and lighting is sufficient. |
| "Low FPS (slow video)." | Lower the video resolution or close unnecessary programs. |

âœ… **Now just:**
- Replace `yourusername/yourrepositoryname` with your GitHub username and repo name.
- Replace `link_to_your_image_or_gif` with your demo image or GIF URL (optional but looks great).
- Save this as `README.md` in your GitHub repo.
